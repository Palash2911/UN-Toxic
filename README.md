### Functionality & Concepts used:
The App has a very simple and interactive interface that helps the user to QUIT SMOKING and Live a better life.
Following are a few android concepts used to achieve the functionalities in the app:

  1. Constraint Layout: Most of the activities in the app uses a flexible constraint layout, which is easy to handle for different screen sizes.
  2. Simple & Easy Views Design: Use of familiar audience EditText with hints and interactive buttons made it easier for Users to register or sign in without 
  providing any detailed instructions pages. Apps also use App Navigation to switch between screens of Progress, Rewards and Tips.
  3. Recycler-View:  To present the Quotes and display the Goals of Users. 
  4. LiveData & Room Database: We are also using LiveData to update the status of goal acheived by user, user information, money added to the wallet in the app, etc. 
  The User Can Update their personal information, add funds to their wallet, and set different goals.
